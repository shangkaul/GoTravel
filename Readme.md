This repo is for a travel domain chatbot made from scratch.
The chat bot is made using Ionic Framework with a dummy NodeJS backend.
The database is a json file db.json.
The apis are deployed on heroku.

To run the code on your machine:
1. Install nodeJS
2. Install ionic v3 and cordova npm packages
3. Clone the repo, run npm install
4. You can serve the app using ionic serve

Alternatively I have provided the finished apks in the repo that can be installed on android devices directly.
There are 2 apks one for the dark version. The other one is with a lighter UI that I saw on pinterest and replicated.
I have attached the screenshots of both.
